# *eAutocomplete*
###### AutoHotkey v1.1.32.00+
***

#### Download the [latest release](https://github.com/A-AhkUser/eAutocomplete/releases)
> notes:
> - **This readme provides an overview of the development version and, as such, may not necessarily reflect your current version. Consider checking out the html file (`eAutocomplete.html`) bundled in the release for an overview of the programmable interface.**
> - Unlike the latest release, the master branch is NOT considered as fully tested on each commit.

The class provides a programmable interface allowing to easily integrate a custom word autocomplete function in a given script or project. Any `Edit`/`RICHEDIT50W` control should be able to be wrapped into an `eAutocomplete` object. Practically, it enables you to quickly find, get info tips and select from a dynamic pre-populated list of data (*e.g.* complete strings, replacement strings) as you type, leveraging typing, definition lookups, searching, translation, filtering *etc.*
