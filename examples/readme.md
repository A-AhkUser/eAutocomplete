In this folder you will find some commented examples illustrating the use and some of the possibilities of the script.
- A_AhkVersionFromLocalData
> *A simple example illustrating the use of suggestion items with associated data.*
- A_AhkVersionFromWebData
> *Similar to A_AhkVersionFromLocalData - this time, however, suggestions' associated data are retrieved from the web.*
- AutocompleteAndTranslate
> *Sample example demonstrating how you can autocomplete the translation of the partially entered string (it uses local data but can easily modify to take advantage of web results instead).*
- Sift
> *This example demonstrates how a custom scoring algorithm can be implemented in order to return custom subsets of suggestions. In this example, we use the [Sift_Regex function](https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=7302) by FanaticGuru.*
