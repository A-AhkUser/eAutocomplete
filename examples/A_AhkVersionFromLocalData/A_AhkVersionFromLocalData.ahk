Autocompletion data are assumed to be described in a linefeed-separated (CRLF, preferably) list
of a TSV-formatted lines.
A line can describe up to three items, in a tabular structure:
- the first tab-separated item represents the string value which is intended to be
displayed in the drop-down list, as an actual suggestion.
- the other two items represent potential replacement strings - aside from being able to
be displayed as info tips.
